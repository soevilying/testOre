translate Russian Chet_snowsfood_9c5eade5:


    e 6 "How sweet."


translate Russian Chet_snowsfood_70e5e23e:

translate Russian Chet_snowsfood_2c8f4ec2:


    e 1 "So how’d you get such a big appetite anyway?"


translate Russian Chet_snowsfood_82c653bf:

translate Russian Chet_snowsfood_0df01db1:


    e 1 "Sure."


translate Russian Chet_snowsfood_8a644f9c:

    c "The first two days were the worst. I looked around,asking, pleading for help but everyone ignored me."


translate Russian Chet_snowsfood_3efc1469:


    c "Then one night, I was cuddled up in a dirty alley ready to faint from exhaustion when a group of rough looking foxes approached me."


translate Russian Chet_snowsfood_7a3f1e5b:


    c "They gave me a piece of bread and a drink from their water pouch."


translate Russian Chet_snowsfood_a2a10019:


    c "I was so thankful that I could never reject what they offered me next."


translate Russian Chet_snowsfood_536acb24:


    c "A chance to survive in the town if I joined their gang."


translate Russian Chet_snowsfood_a309dfff:


    c "Turns out they were a group of thieves, and they always needed smaller recruits for the harder to reach places."


translate Russian Chet_snowsfood_a4c2ecd7:


    c "I ended up being their servant boy, serving their every whim to keep them satisfied. "
