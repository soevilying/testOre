translate Russian Bread_map_start_28f40246:

translate Russian Bread_map_start_e3f19f11:


    e 1 "And the reason is?"


translate Russian Bread_map_start_dfce592c:


    b "I'm not really a knight. More of a knight in training."


translate Russian Bread_map_start_741719be:


    b "I want to be a real knight [name], but I cannot do that alone."


translate Russian Bread_map_start_7898473d:

translate Russian Bread_map_start_d57fecda:

translate Russian Bread_map_start_58b358c9:

translate Russian Bread_map_start_6db5a2b9:

translate Russian Bread_map_start_7d1c486e:


    b "Yes!"


translate Russian Bread_map_start_e70265dc:


    e 1 "Then pack your things, and let's move out to the tavern."


translate Russian Bread_map_start_d56d5599:

translate Russian Bread_map_start_8bbfaa68:

translate Russian Bread_map_start_386a4d17:

translate Russian Bread_map_start_23d17ec0:


    e 1 "Well if you are comfortable and you’re sure you can fight still, I guess what you're doing isn't so bad."


translate Russian Bread_map_start_98d79cbd:

translate Russian Bread_map_start_899364e9:

translate Russian Bread_map_start_993fa208:

    e 1 "Excuse me?"


translate Russian Bread_map_start_e5dd8234:


    b "I’m technically not a full fledged knight, more of a knight in training."


translate Russian Bread_map_start_2f04888f:


    b "Captain Asmund said I could not have the title of knight until he deemed me ready."


translate Russian Bread_map_start_80bad539:


    b "And I doubt that’s possible now…"


translate Russian Bread_map_start_7d91dc94:


    b "So, could you take me under your wing and allow me to earn the title of knight?"


translate Russian Bread_map_start_a952b520:


    e 1 "I mean, I could just give it to you right now."


translate Russian Bread_map_start_605711f5:


    b "That’s not how it works."


translate Russian Bread_map_start_2239342e:


    b "I need to be tested, and only a true mentor can see if I am ready."


translate Russian Bread_map_start_ed841ec5:

translate Russian Bread_map_start_5e17b9f0:

translate Russian Bread_map_start_47746f39:

translate Russian Bread_map_start_1856ecdf:
