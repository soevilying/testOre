translate Japanese Ebb_meet_88821fb5:


    "The orca’s distraught stings your heart."


translate Japanese Ebb_meet_d866dcb0:


    "But even you find it hard to say anything hopeful for fear it will just be empty promises that will break him further."


translate Japanese Ebb_meet_fb288e05:


    "All you know is that he needs help, and the longer time passes the slimmer the chances of bringing his Young Master back."


translate Japanese Ebb_meet_15257818:
